# Assessing the Performance of Cryptocurrencies Using the Two-Type Branching Process in a Random Environment

## Project Overview

This project investigates the performance of five major cryptocurrencies (Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple) over a six-year period (2018-2023). The analysis utilizes daily price data to evaluate positive and negative returns using thresholds of 0.02 and -0.02, respectively. A two-type branching process in a random environment is employed to model and analyze the performance.

## Key Feature

**Limit Distribution in Random Environment**

The visualization showcases the limit distribution of the difference in negative and positive returns. Probabilities for the random environment are weighted based on historical data:

- **2018-2019**: Initial probabilities.
- **2020-2021**: Increased weight to reflect more recent trends.
- **2022-2023**: Highest weight to emphasize current market conditions.
  This weighting approach highlights the evolving market behavior and its influence on return patterns.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. View the visualizations embedded below.
3. Run the provided scripts to replicate or extend the analysis.

## Conclusion

Bitcoin demonstrates the strongest resilience against negative returns, outperforming other cryptocurrencies. Binance Coin and Ethereum also show a good ability to avoid negative returns but are not as robust as Bitcoin. On the other hand, Ripple and Litecoin are less effective at minimizing negative returns. Overall, Bitcoin is the most resilient, while Ripple and Litecoin are less effective in this regard.
This project demonstrates how branching processes and random environments can provide unique insights into cryptocurrency performance. By leveraging weighted historical data, it offers a nuanced perspective on market trends and return dynamics.
